We have compiled 13 competency questions to indicate the scope. These competency questions are also accompanied by SPARQL queries. We use brackets, in the questions, to denote variables.

The text file lists the 14 competency questions and their corresponding SPARQL queries for validation of the ontology's content. The format used in the .txt file is as follows:

{CQ Number} {Competency question}

{SPARQL QUERY}
